			<p>
WhatsApp is the most popular communication application in many countries, including the US, UK, Germany and many developing countries such as Brazil, India, and Mexico (where many people use it as an interface to the web). Due to its encrypted and peer-to-peer nature, it is hard for researchers to study which content people share through WhatsApp at scale. Its relevance, however, means that it is important for researchers to study its growth, usage and impact. 
</p><p>
In an attempt to support the research community, this tutorial will present tools and methodologies for collecting WhatsApp public group data. It will be separated into two parts. In the first part, we will present tools and underlying techniques for collecting data from public WhatsApp groups. In the second part, we will showcase some of our recent research using WhatsApp data and introduce our system, WhatsApp Monitor, a web-based system that helps researchers and journalists to explore the nature of content shared on WhatsApp. Our tool monitors multiple content categories such as images, videos, audio, and textual messages posted on a set of WhatsApp groups and displays the most shared content per day. 
</p><p>
The tutorial covers practical as well as analytical techniques for obtaining and exploring WhatsApp data. The goal will be to train researchers and other interested parties in how they can collect and analyze WhatsApp group data within the context of their own studies.
