<p>I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Communication and Information at Rutgers university. Prior to that, I was the <a href="https://idss.mit.edu/academics/ses_doc/hammer-fellows/">Michael Hammer Post-doc</a> at the <a href="https://idss.mit.edu/">Institute for Data, Society and Systems</a> at MIT. Prior to that I spent a year working with Prof. <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/">Robert West</a> in the <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/">Data science lab</a> at EPFL. I finished my PhD at Aalto University, Helsinki, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.kth.se/profile/argioni">Aris Gionis</a>. My PhD thesis was on identifying and countering online polarization using algorithmic techniques. My broad research interests is in the area of Computational Social Science, and applications of AI. </p>
	<p>Before starting my PhD, I worked at Yahoo Research and Qatar Computing Research Institute for a few years. I completed my Masters and Bachelors in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIIT-Hyderabad</a>.
	<p>Over the past few years, I've been trying to work on inter-disciplinary problems with applications in the global south. I've been fortunate enough to work on a wide range of topics (see <a href="projects.html">here</a>), bring my expertise from computer science collaborating with sociologists, psychologists, political scientists, journalists and demographers (See <a href="publications.html">publications</a>). My work has been covered extensively in the <a href="media.html">media</a>.</p>
	<p>My current research is focused on building innovative, opt-in, privacy preserving data-collection tools for platforms like WhatsApp, with the goal of developing interventions to stop/slow the spread of misinformation.</p>
