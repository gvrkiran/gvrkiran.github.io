OK, this is exciting. Finally, after years of just writing content for my blog privately, I am thinking of trying out something publicly. I guess its a `phase' and might die out soon.

Some ideas of what I want to write about in the future:

- About being an academic
- Why I think we should research global south more
- Being careful doing interdisciplinary work and why it sucks
- Being a PhD student
