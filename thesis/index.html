	<h2>Abstract:</h2>
	<p>
	This thesis provides a broad overview of polarization on social media,
along with algorithmic techniques to identify polarized topics,
understanding their properties over time, and
finally, to reduce polarization.
	</p>

	<p>
	First, we provide methods to <b>identify polarized topics automatically</b>
from social-media streams.
Our methods are mainly based on interaction networks,
i.e., networks of social media users, connected through certain types of interactions.
We first show that polarized topics have a special bi-clustered structure in their retweet network
and propose an algorithm to quantify the degree of polarization by using a random walk on this network.
We then make use of subgraph patterns (motifs) in the reply network of users to show that we can
easily identify polarized topics using such patterns.
Since our analysis does not use content, our methods are able to generalize to any topic, domain and language.
	</p>

	<p>
	Next, we study the <b>dynamic aspects of the process of polarization</b>.
We understand what happens to the interaction networks defined above in case of
a sudden increase in interest of users on the topic.
We then address the question on whether polarization on Twitter has increased over the last 8 years
and find evidence to support that it does.
	</p>

	<p>
	Finally, given these findings, we <b>design algorithms to reduce polarization</b>. We propose two approaches.
In the first approach, we propose connecting users with opposing viewpoints in order to reduce polarization.
Our method takes into account the users' interests and their current level of polarization
to help them get connected to the people they feel comfortable in doing so.
In the second approach, we take an information-diffusion route. We pose the problem of reducing polarization
as a task of spreading information that reaches both sides of the polarized topic.
	</p>

	<p>
Given the ever-increasing polarization in the society, almost everywhere in the world, and the real-world
impact of polarized discussions (e.g., brexit, trump, etc.), the advances made in this
thesis are necessary, relevant and timely.

						Which topics spark the most heated debates on social media? Identifying those topics is not only interesting from a societal point of view, but also allows the filtering and aggregation of social media content for disseminating news stories. In this paper, we perform a systematic methodological study of controversy detection by using the content and the network structure of social media.
						</p>
						<p>
Unlike previous work, rather than study controversy in a single hand-picked topic and use domain specific knowledge, we take a general approach to study topics in any domain. Our approach to quantifying controversy is based on a graph-based three-stage pipeline, which involves (i) building a conversation graph about a topic; (ii) partitioning the conversation graph to identify potential sides of the controversy; and (iii) measuring the amount of controversy from characteristics of the graph.
						</p>
						<p>
We perform an extensive comparison of controversy measures, different graph-building approaches, and data sources. We use both controversial and non-controversial topics on Twitter, as well as other external datasets. We find that our new random-walk-based measure outperforms existing ones in capturing the intuitive notion of controversy, and show that content features are vastly less helpful in this task.

							<p>
							Among the topics discussed in Social Media, some lead
to controversy. A number of recent studies have focused
on the problem of identifying controversy in social
media mostly based on the analysis of textual content
or rely on global network structure. Such approaches
have strong limitations due to the difficulty
of understanding natural language, and of investigating
the global network structure.
<p>
</p>
In this work we show that it is possible to detect controversy
in social media by exploiting network motifs,
i.e., local patterns of user interaction. The proposed
approach allows for a language-independent and finegrained
and efficient-to-compute analysis of user discussions
and their evolution over time. The supervised
model exploiting motif patterns can achieve 85% accuracy,
with an improvement of 7% compared to baseline
structural, propagation-based and temporal network
features.

							We study the evolution of long-lived controversial debates as manifested
on Twitter from 2011 to 2016. Specifically, we explore how
the structure of interactions and content of discussion varies with
the level of collective attention, as evidenced by the number of
users discussing a topic. Spikes in the volume of users typically
correspond to external events that increase the public attention on
the topic, for instance, discussions about 'gun control' often erupt
after a mass shooting.
<p>
</p>
This work is the first to study the dynamic evolution of polarized
online debates at such scale. By employing a wide array of network
and content analysis measures, we find consistent evidence that
increased collective attention is associated with increased network
polarization and network concentration within each side of the
debate; and overall more uniform lexicon usage across all users.

							Social media has played an important role in shaping political
discourse over the last decade. It is often perceived to have
increased political polarization, thanks to the scale of discussions
and their public nature. Here, we try to answer whether
political polarization in the US on Twitter has increased over
the last eight years. We analyze a large longitudinal Twitter
dataset of 679,000 users and look at signs of polarization in
their (i) network - how people follow political and media accounts,
(ii) tweeting behavior - whether they retweet content
from both sides, and (iii) content - how partisan the hashtags
they use are. Our analysis shows that online polarization has
indeed increased over the past eight years and that, depending
on the measure, the relative change is 10%-20%. Our study
is one of very few with such a long-term perspective, encompassing
two US presidential elections and two mid-term elections,
providing a rare longitudinal analysis

							Society is often polarized by controversial issues, that split the population into groups of opposing views. When such issues emerge on social media, we often observe the creation of 'echo chambers', i.e., situations where like-minded people reinforce each other's opinion, but do not get exposed to the views of the opposing side. In this paper we study algorithmic techniques for bridging these chambers, and thus, reducing controversy. Specifically, we represent the discussion on a controversial issue with an endorsement graph, and cast our problem as an edge-recommendation problem on this graph. The goal of the recommendation is to reduce the controversy score of the graph, which is measured by a recently-developed metric based on random walks. At the same time, we take into account the acceptance probability of the recommended edge, which represents how likely the edge is to materialize in the endorsement graph. We propose a simple model based on a recently-developed user-level controversy score, that is competitive with state-of- the-art link-prediction algorithms. We thus aim at finding the edges that produce the largest reduction in the controversy score, in expectation. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient algorithm, which considers only a fraction of all the combinations of possible edges. Experimental results show that our algorithm is more efficient than a simple greedy heuristic, while producing comparable score reduction. Finally, a comparison with other state-of-the-art edge-addition algorithms shows that this problem is fundamentally different from what has been studied in the literature.

							Polarization is a troubling phenomenon that can lead to societal
divisions and hurt the democratic process. It is therefore important
to develop methods to reduce it.
We propose an algorithmic solution to the problem of reducing
polarization. The core idea is to expose users to content that
challenges their point of view, with the hope broadening their perspective,
and thus reduce their polarity. Our method takes into
account several aspects of the problem, such as the estimated polarity
of the user, the probability of accepting the recommendation,
the polarity of the content, and popularity of the content being
recommended.
</p>
<p>
We evaluate our recommendations via a large-scale user study
on Twitter users that were actively involved in the discussion of
the US elections results. Results shows that, in most cases, the
factors taken into account in the recommendation affect the users
as expected, and thus capture the essential features of the problem.

							Social media has brought a revolution on how people are consuming news. Beyond the undoubtedly large number of advantages brought by social-media platforms, a point of criticism has been the creation of echo chambers and filter bubbles, caused by social homophily and algorithmic personalization.
In this paper we address the problem of balancing the information exposure in a social network. We assume that two opposing campaigns (or viewpoints) are present in the network, and that network nodes have different preferences towards these campaigns. Our goal is to find two sets of nodes to employ in the respective campaigns, so that the overall information exposure for the two campaigns is balanced. We formally define the problem, characterize its hardness, develop approximation algorithms, and present experimental evaluation results.
</p>
<p>
Our model is inspired by the literature on influence maximization, but we offer significant novelties. First, balance of information exposure is modeled by a symmetric difference function, which is neither monotone nor submodular, and thus, not amenable to existing approaches. Second, while previous papers consider a setting with selfish agents and provide bounds on best response strategies (i.e., move of the last player), we consider a setting with a centralized agent and provide bounds for a global objective function.

							Echo chambers, i.e., situations where one is exposed only to opinions that agree with their own, are an increasing concern for the political discourse in many democratic countries. This paper studies the phenomenon of political echo chambers on social media. We identify the two components in the phenomenon: the opinion that is shared ('echo'), and the place that allows its exposure ('chamber' --- the social network), and examine closely at how these two components interact. We define a production and consumption measure for social-media users, which captures the political leaning of the content shared and received by them. By comparing the two, we find that Twitter users are, to a large degree, exposed to political opinions that agree with their own. We also find that users who try to bridge the echo chambers, by sharing content with diverse leaning, have to pay a 'price of bipartisanship' in terms of their network centrality and content appreciation. In addition, we study the role of 'gatekeepers', users who consume content with diverse leaning but produce partisan content (with a single-sided leaning), in the formation of echo chambers. Finally, we apply these findings to the task of predicting partisans and gatekeepers from social and content features. While partisan users turn out relatively easy to identify, gatekeepers prove to be more challenging.

	<p>
	First, we provide methods to identify polarized topics automatically
from social-media streams.
Our methods are mainly based on interaction networks,
i.e., networks of social media users, connected through certain types of interactions.
We first show that polarized topics have a special bi-clustered structure in their retweet network
and propose an algorithm to quantify the degree of polarization by using a random walk on this network.
We then make use of subgraph patterns (motifs) in the reply network of users to show that we can
easily identify polarized topics using such patterns.
Since our analysis does not use content, our methods are able to generalize to any topic, domain and language.
	</p>

	<p>
	Next, we study the dynamic aspects of the process of polarization.
We understand what happens to the interaction networks defined above in case of
a sudden increase in interest of users on the topic.
We then address the question on whether polarization on Twitter has increased over the last 8 years
and find evidence to support that it does.
	</p>

	<p>
	Finally, given these findings, we design algorithms to reduce polarization. We propose two approaches.
In the first approach, we propose connecting users with opposing viewpoints in order to reduce polarization.
Our method takes into account the users' interests and their current level of polarization
to help them get connected to the people they feel comfortable in doing so.
In the second approach, we take an information-diffusion route. We pose the problem of reducing polarization
as a task of spreading information that reaches both sides of the polarized topic.
	</p>

	<p>
Given the ever-increasing polarization in the society, almost everywhere in the world, and the real-world
impact of polarized discussions (e.g., brexit, trump, etc.), the advances made in this
thesis are necessary, relevant and timely.
